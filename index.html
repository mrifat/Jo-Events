      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p>Jo Events, short to Jordan Events, is my graduation project, developed using Ruby on Rails.</br>
        It distributes event tickets online, lets say you have an event and you want to distribute tickets for, you sign up to the website and create your event, you give it a title, description, you specify the capacity and you set the date and time of the event and ofcourse the location via Google maps.</br>

At the beginning, Jo Event was supposed to handle events in Jordan only, but now I modified it so it can handle events all around the world.</br>

Once you create the event, users can start getting their tickets after logging in/signing up to the website, they pick an event and receive their tickets via email as a QR code generated using Google's API.</br>

Jo Events also has an Android <a href="https://github.com/MRifat/Jo-Events-Android-app">mobile application</a> which operates as a ticket holder or a ticket scanner depending on the credentials entered by the user.<br>

In order to use the mobile application you must first install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuenhpbmcuY2xpZW50LmFuZHJvaWQiXQ..">zxing</a> application since it depends on it to operate.</p><br>
